      - Search through [existing issues](https://github.com/BennyExtreme/yet-another-factory-planner/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3Aquestion) first to ensure that this question has not been asked before.
      - Write a descriptive title for your issue. Avoid generic or vague titles such as "Some questions" or "Help needed".
      - Keep your issue focused on one single question. If you have multiple questions to ask, please create separate issues for each of them.
      - Provide as much context as possible in the question section. Include screenshots, screen recordings, links, references, or anything else you may consider relevant.
